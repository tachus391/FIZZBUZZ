# FIZZBUZZ
FizzBuzz is a well known programming assignment, asked during interviews. The given code solves the FizzBuzz problem and uses my name "Temi" and "Tope" instead of "Fizz" and "Buzz"
It takes an input n and outputs the numbers from 1 to n.

For each multiple of 3, it prints "temi" instead of the number.

For each multiple of 5, prints "tope" instead of the number.

For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, output "temitope".

The code to skips even numbers, so the logic only applies to odd numbers in the range.
